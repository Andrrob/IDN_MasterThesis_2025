# Repository Overview
This repository contains the original code components developed for my master's thesis in Electronic Systems Design and Innovation. Due to intellectual property considerations, only code fully authored by me is included - the Virtual BodyWorks framework and proprietary XR integration components are not shared here.

# Code Components
Core AI Agent Implementation
Agent.py - Main AI agent implementation

Agents_environment.py - Definition of the agent's operating environment


Analysis Scripts
prepare_data.py - Cleans and merges survey data with experimental recordings

AnalyseData.py - Processes and summarizes all experimental recordings into a consolidated CSV file

statistical_group_tests.py - Contains statistical comparison methods between experimental groups

MultivariatRegresjon.py - Performs multiple linear regression analyses

analyze_states.py - Summarizes state occurrences and visualizes them in bubble plots

visualize_group_distances.py - Generates visualizations of distance metrics across three experimental groups

# Usage Note
The complete system required integration with Virtual BodyWorks' proprietary XR framework, which is not included in this repository. These scripts represent only the original components developed independently for the thesis work.
